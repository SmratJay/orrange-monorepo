# üö® CRITICAL PRODUCTION SECURITY CHECKLIST

## ‚ùå DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED UNTIL ALL ITEMS COMPLETED

This checklist addresses the **critical production readiness gaps** identified in the tech lead security audit.

---

## üîí **TIER 1: CRITICAL SECURITY (DEPLOYMENT BLOCKERS)**

### Authentication & Session Management
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Replace mock JWT middleware with production `AuthService`
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement secure session revocation via Redis
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Generate cryptographically secure JWT secrets (64+ chars)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Set JWT access tokens to 15-minute expiry maximum
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement refresh token rotation
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Add rate limiting on auth endpoints (5 attempts/minute)

### Secret Management
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Remove `ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY` from environment variables
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Set up secret rotation (90-day maximum)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Enable secret access auditing
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Separate staging/production secret stores

### Smart Contract Security
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Professional third-party security audit required
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Test all timeout scenarios (expired trades)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Verify pausability works for emergency stops
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Test dispute resolution with all edge cases
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Verify no funds can be locked permanently

## üíæ **TIER 2: DATA INTEGRITY (HIGH PRIORITY)**

### Database Security
- [ ] **COMPLETED**: Removed sensitive payment data from schema ‚úÖ
- [ ] **COMPLETED**: Implemented soft delete pattern ‚úÖ
- [ ] **COMPLETED**: Added critical performance indexes ‚úÖ
- [ ] **PENDING**: Set up automated database backups
- [ ] **PENDING**: Implement point-in-time recovery
- [ ] **PENDING**: Add database connection encryption
- [ ] **PENDING**: Set up read replicas for performance

### Audit Trail
- [ ] **PENDING**: Ensure all user actions are logged
- [ ] **PENDING**: Implement immutable audit log storage
- [ ] **PENDING**: Set up log retention policy (7+ years)
- [ ] **PENDING**: Add compliance reporting endpoints

---

## üìä **TIER 3: OBSERVABILITY (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**

### Monitoring
- [ ] **STARTED**: Basic observability service created ‚úÖ
- [ ] **PENDING**: Add Sentry error tracking
- [ ] **PENDING**: Add Pino structured logging  
- [ ] **PENDING**: Set up Prometheus metrics collection
- [ ] **PENDING**: Create Grafana dashboards
- [ ] **PENDING**: Add alerting for critical events

### Performance
- [ ] **PENDING**: Add API response time monitoring
- [ ] **PENDING**: Set up database query performance tracking
- [ ] **PENDING**: Add memory and CPU usage alerts
- [ ] **PENDING**: Implement health check endpoints

---

## üåê **TIER 4: INFRASTRUCTURE (PRODUCTION READY)**

### Deployment Security
- [ ] **PENDING**: Set up CI/CD with security scanning
- [ ] **PENDING**: Add container vulnerability scanning
- [ ] **PENDING**: Implement blue-green deployments
- [ ] **PENDING**: Set up automated rollback on health failures

### Network Security
- [ ] **PENDING**: Configure HTTPS with A+ SSL rating
- [ ] **PENDING**: Add DDoS protection (Cloudflare/AWS Shield)
- [ ] **PENDING**: Set up VPC with private subnets
- [ ] **PENDING**: Configure network access control lists

---

## üîß **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED (This Session)**
1. **Payment Data Security**: Removed sensitive payment storage from database
2. **Architecture Cleanup**: Consolidated redundant services and matching engines
3. **Database Hardening**: Added soft delete, performance indexes, safe relations
4. **Enhanced Auth System**: Built production-grade JWT with session management
5. **Admin Platform**: Created comprehensive moderator/admin tools
6. **Observability Foundation**: Basic logging and metrics infrastructure

### üö® **CRITICAL NEXT ACTIONS REQUIRED**

1. **SECRET MANAGEMENT** (IMMEDIATE)
   ```bash
   # NEVER deploy with private keys in environment variables
   # Set up Vault/AWS Secrets Manager FIRST
   ```

2. **SMART CONTRACT AUDIT** (BEFORE MAINNET)
   ```bash
   # Professional audit required
   # Budget: $20,000-50,000 for comprehensive audit
   ```

3. **MONITORING INTEGRATION** (WEEK 1)
   ```bash
   npm install pino @sentry/node @prometheus-node/client
   # Add to package.json and configure
   ```

4. **AUTHENTICATION TESTING** (WEEK 1)
   ```bash
   # Test token expiry, revocation, edge cases
   # Security penetration testing required
   ```
