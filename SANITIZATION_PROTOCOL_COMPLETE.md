## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS

### 🚨 **WEEK 1 DAY 1: THE GREAT SEVERANCE**
**TARGET:** `services/api/prisma/schema.prisma`

**CRITICAL MISSION:** Delete P2PPaymentMethod model
```prisma
// ⚠️ LEGAL LIABILITY - MUST DELETE
model P2PPaymentMethod {
  id              String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId          String
  paymentType     String   // "bank_transfer", "digital_wallet", etc.
  paymentDetails  Json     // 🔥 SENSITIVE FINANCIAL DATA
  isActive        Boolean  @default(true)
  // ... MORE SENSITIVE FIELDS
}
```

**BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION:** Storing raw financial details = massive legal liability + GDPR violation

---

### 🛡️ **WEEK 1 DAY 2: DATABASE FORTRESS**
**TARGET:** Remove `paymentDetails Json` from P2PTrade model
**REPLACEMENT:** Reference-only architecture with external secure vault

---

### ⚡ **WEEK 1 DAYS 3-5: SMART CONTRACT RESURRECTION**
**TARGET:** `contracts/OrrangeEscrowV2.sol`
**MISSION:** Fix logically inverted contract (currently backwards)

---

## 📊 PROJECT HEALTH STATUS

### 🟢 **HEALTHY COMPONENTS (Keep)**
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline** - Production-ready with full quality gates
- ✅ **Authentication System** - Clean jose implementation
- ✅ **Database Schema** - Core structure sound (minus P2PPaymentMethod)
- ✅ **API Routes** - Core trading functionality intact
- ✅ **Frontend Components** - Basic structure operational

### 🔴 **CRITICAL FLAWS (4-Week Fix Plan)**
- 🚨 **P2PPaymentMethod Model** - Legal time bomb (Week 1)
- 🚨 **Smart Contract Logic** - Completely inverted (Week 1)
- ⚠️ **Backend Services** - Need escrow service rebuild (Week 2)
- ⚠️ **Production Infrastructure** - Missing deployment automation (Week 3)
- ⚠️ **Frontend Integration** - Smart contract binding broken (Week 4)
